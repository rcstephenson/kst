.SH DESCRIPTION
kst is a graphical data plotting tool, which includes the ability
to plot live data (contiuously update the plot as new data becomes
available).  

kst may be run entirely from within its GUI, in which case no
command line arguments are needed.  kst has a powerful wizard for
easily setting up new plots.  

In the second invocation, kst loads pre-saved plot specifications from the
file
.I kstfile
and optionally may override some of the settings in that file.

In the third invocation, kst displays plots of the data as directed in 
the default manner.  Additional datasources may be specified on the 
command line with options for that datasource following it.  Command
line options generally apply to all subsequent options unless later
overridden.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-A\fR
plot all curves in separate plots
.TP
.B \-a\fR
average frames (simple mean) when plotting with
.B -s\fR.
.TP
.B \-\-A4\fR
use A4 sized paper for printing.  Requires
.B \-\-print\fR.
.TP
.B \-b\fR
plot as bargraphs.
.TP
.B \-d\fR
use points when plotting curves.
.TP
.B \-e\ FIELD\fR
use
.I FIELD
as the magnitude of error bars applied to the next plot.
.TP
.BR \-F\ datasource\fR
override the datasource indicated in the 
.I kstfile
and instead use
.I datasource\fR.
.TP
.B \-f\ STARTFRAME\fR
begin plotting at
.I STARTFRAME
frames into the data.  Set to -1 to start at
.I NUMFRAMES
from the end of the data.
.TP
.B \-h\ FIELD\fR
plot
.I FIELD
as a histogram.
.TP
.B \-l\fR
use lines when plotting curves.
.TP
.B \-\-landscape\fR
use landscape orientation for printing.  Requires
.B \-\-print\fR.
.B \-\-Letter\fR
use US Letter sized paper for printing.  Requires
.B \-\-print\fR.
.TP
.B \-n\ NUMFRAMES\fR
plot at most
.I NUMFRAMES
frames of data.  Set to -1 to indicate all of the data.
.TP
.B \-P\ PLOTNAME\fR
plot all plots in the plot named
.I PLOTNAME\fR.
.TP
.B \-p\ FIELD\fR
plot
.I FIELD
as a power spectrum plot.
.TP
.B \-\-png\ filename\fR
render to a portable network graphics (png) image with file name 
.I filename
and quit.
.TP
.B \-\-portrait\fR
use portrait orientation for printing.  Requires
.B \-\-print\fR.
.TP
.B \-\-print\ filename
print the plot to file
.I filename
and quit.
.TP
.B \-s\ FRAMESPERSAMPLE\fR
plot every
.I FRAMESPERSAMPLE
frames when plotting.
.TP
.B \-x\ FIELD\fR
use
.I FIELD
as the X-axis vector.
.TP
.B \-y\ FIELD\fR
plot
.I FIELD\fR
as an XY plot.
.TP
.B \-z\ FIELD\fR
plot
.I FIELD
as an image.
.SH EXAMPLES
Plot all data in column 2 from data.dat.
       kst data.dat -y 2

Same as above, except only read 20 lines, starting at line 10.
       kst data.dat -f 10 -n 20 -y 2

also read col 1. One plot per curve.
       kst data.dat -f 10 -n 20 -y 1 -y 2

Read col 1 from data2.dat and col 1 from data.dat
       kst data.dat -f 10 -n 20 -y 2 data2.dat -y 1

Same as above, except read 40 lines starting at 30 in data2.dat
       kst data.dat -f 10 -n 20 -y 2 data2.dat -f 30 -n 40 -y 1

Specify the X vector and error bars:
Plot x = col 1 and Y = col 2 and error flags = col 3 from data.dat
       kst data.dat -x 1 -e 3 -y 2

Get the X vector from data1.dat, and the Y vector from data2.dat.
       kst data1.dat -x 1 data2.dat -y 1

Placement:
Plot column 2 and column 3 in plot P1 and column 4 in plot P2
       kst data.dat -P P1 -y 2 -y 3 -P P2 -y 4
.SH BUGS
