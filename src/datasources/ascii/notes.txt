Notes for the ASCII data source
-------------------------------


Time
----

Two time modes are supported:

1) C Time
   Equivalent to time_t, including epoch.  This is an absolute measure.

2) Seconds
   This is a relative measure.  Time is equivalent to the value of the index
   vector in seconds



Broken
------
1) We have to update() from the constructor because KstRVector doesn't update
the data source.  This has to be reworked in Kst-core so that the update thread
no longer does data sources.  Should give a performance boost.

2) Time code is unfinished.
