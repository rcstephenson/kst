PyKst is, at the time of writing, not stable enough for serious use.
For the time being, do not write scripts with it except to test and to send feedback.

PyKst is tested on Python 2.6 and does not work with Python 3.x.

PyKst needs NumPy 1.6 and does not work with NumPy 1.5. If it is very important
that it should work with NumPy 1.5, modify pykstpp.py to work with the old
API (and submit these changes to kst!!) or send an email to the devel list.

PyKst currently is not portable as pykstpp.py contains C++ code which is
compiled upon first use. It should, instead, create a dynamic library at
Kst compile time. Also, it does not detect the location of the Qt library or
include files, so to get it to compile you might have to modify pykstpp.py.

Please email the Kst list with feature requests and bug reports. I am not able to work on
scripting as much as I have had the chance to do in the past two weeks because of
high school, but can certainly try to help with relatively minor fixes.

The fastest way to get started is to take a look at the examples inside the svn tree
at pyKst/

Documentation is available for now at hen.astro.utoronto.ca/pyKst or inside the
svn tree at pyKst/doc.
