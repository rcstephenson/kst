.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\fB[file\&.\&.\&.]\fR
A \&.kst file, or one or more data files\&. Supported formats are ASCII columns, BOOMERANG frame files, BLAST dirfile files, and other optionally supported types\&. A \&.kst files stores all options that can be set by other flags\&. The following flags can be used to override the options set in the \&.kst file: \fB\-F datafile\fR, \fB\-n NS\fR, \fB\-s NS\fR, \fB\-f F0\fR, \fB\-a\fR\&. The rest can not be overridden\&. If an override flag is given, it is applied to all vectors in the plot\&.

ASCII data from stdin can be plotted by including "stdin" in the list \fB[file\&.\&.\&.]\fR\&.

.TP
\fB\-y Y\fR
The source for the Y axis data\&. For ASCII files, this is the column\&. For binary files, this is the field name\&. To plot multiple curves, this may be specified multiple times\&. The same source file, sample ranges, and X axis data are assumed\&.

.TP
\fB\-e E\fR
Error bars for Y axis data\&. For ASCII file, refer to the column holding the data\&. For binary files use the field name\&. If multiple \fB\-y Y\fR options are given, this may also be used multiple times\&. Individual Y entries are associated in order with multiple E entries\&.

.TP
\fB\-x X\fR
The source for the X axis data\&. For ASCII files, this is the column\&. For readata files, this is the field name\&. If this option is not specified, the row number in the file is used\&. This option can only be given once\&.

.TP
\fB\-z Z\fR
The source for the Z matrix data (which gets displayed as an image)\&. For ASCII files, this is the column containing the z data\&. For other optional formats (HEALPix, FITS image, etc), this is the name of the desired matrix field, as displayed in the matrix dialog\&. Some matrix\-compatible datasources also allow using an alias which is the number of the desired matrix field\&. To plot multiple matrices, this may be specified multiple times\&.

.TP
\fB\-p P\fR
The source for power spectra\&. For ASCII files, this is the column\&. For binary files, this is the field name\&. To plot power spectra of multiple curves, this may be specified multiple times\&. The same source file, sample ranges and fft lengths are used for all Power Spectra requested from the command line\&.

.TP
\fB\-l P\fR
The length of the FFT used in power specra estimation is 2^P\&.

.TP
\fB\-h H\fR
The source for histograms\&. For ASCII files, this is the column\&. For binary files, this is the field name\&. Multiple histograms can be defined from the command line\&.

.TP
\fB\-m NC\fR
Used when multiple curves have been defined\&. Rather than plotting all curves in the same plot, plot each in its own plot,

.TP
\fB\-f F0\fR
The starting frame number (for readdata files) or row (for ASCII files) to read\&.

.TP
\fB\-n\fR
The number of frames (for readdata files) or rows (for ASCII files) to read\&.

.TP
\fB\-s NS\fR
The number of frames or rows to skip each read\&. This is useful when working with very large data files, to speed up response and conserve memory, in the case that the data are slowly varying\&.

.TP
\fB\-a\fR
Used in with the \fB \-s NS\fR: rather than skipping each NS frames, average them\&. This provides a combination of very basic high pass filtering, and memory conservation\&.

.TP
\fB\-F Datafile\fR
Override the file to read the data from for all vectors listed in the \&.kst file\&. Can only be used in conjunction with a kst file\&.

.TP
\fB\-\-print psfile\fR
Rather than displaying the plot, export the image to a postscript file and exit\&. *BUG note: even though no windows are opened on screen, access to the X server is still required\&.*

.TP
\fB\-\-png pngfile\fR
Rather than displaying the plot, export the image to a png file of dimensions 640x480 and exit\&. *BUG note: even though no windows are opened on screen, access to the X server is still required\&.*
