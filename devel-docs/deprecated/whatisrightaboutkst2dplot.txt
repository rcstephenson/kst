Kst2Dplot rocks:  Here's why:
(loosing just one of these, while fixing every single item in 
whatiswrongwithkst2dplot.txt would be a loss).

1) Well spaced and scaled axis labels

2) Well placed and scaled axis numbers

3) great default tick size and spacing

4) good control over tick density

5) rotateable axis numbers

6) Time interpretation for axis numbers (many sources, many output formats)

7) rotatable axis numbers

8) Optional major and minor grid lines

9) adjustable forground, background colors

10) adjustable major and minor gridline colors

11) surpressable borders for adjacent plots

12) easy interface to log-log, log-linear, and linear-log plots

13) Transformable top and right axis

14) Convenient autoscale

15) auto-border mode for plots

16) Spike insensitive autoscale for glitchy data

17) Fixed scale mode.

18) Excellent mouse interface to fixed scale mode

19) convenient ability to change only X or Y zooming with the mouse

20) rmb interface to match axes between plots

21) plots borders auto-align when plots are in a grid

22) plot markers

23) rmb access to filtering or fitting curves

24) exponetial notation in log plots, when reasonable

25) plots can display curves and images

26) clicking outside the plot region brings up plot dialog on useful page

27) very useful keyboard interface: (lots of items here)

28) plots inherit all the coolness of view objects.
