How to make a Kst release:

- update from SVN
- svn copy to a branch
- edit RELEASE.NOTES
- run a regression test and make sure it completely passes
- update configure.in.in to set the version number and the libkst interface
  version
- update ../doc
- make sure documentation has correct version for the <releaseinfo> tag
  of index.docbook and correct version of KST, QT, and KDE in the installation
  instructions of install-chapter.docbook
- update the manpage
- prepare for a KDE 3.3 install!  Set min config appropriately
- svn copy to a tag
- make sure configure has been run so that the spec file is created (with the
  appropriate prefix, otherwise it must be editted after)
- disable unsermake
- svn2dist /path/to/extragear/graphics kst -b -n kst -v <version_number> --svn-root https://svn.kde.org/home/kde/trunk/ -l svn2dist.log --i18n-module extragear-graphics
- unpack, remove any files that shouldn't be there, make sure docs and i18n
  are packaged properly, and edit any paths necessary (ex: spec file)
- generate the srpm: rpm -ts kst-version.tar.gz
- generate rpms as needed: rpm -tb kst-version.tar.gz
                        or rpm --rebuild kst-version.rpm
     - SuSE and RedHat style are typically generated.
