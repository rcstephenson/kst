Kst is designed as a multi-layer application.  The core is intended to be small
and well-focused on the core functionality.  Additional features and
functionality are implemented as plugins, extensions, or datasource plugins.


libkst
------
This contains the bare minimum required by Kst extensions in order for them to
cleanly link and be sufficiently powerful to perform their tasks.  It should
not contain any data or view object code at this time.

libkstmath
----------
All non-gui dependent math code and data objects (equations, PSDs, etc) go
here.  This is not presently installed.

d2asc
-----
A command line utility to convert any kst supported data file into ascii.

kst
---
This is the core executable.  It links to libkst, qt, KDE, and not much else.
kst proper contains only main.cpp.  The rest is in libkstapp.

extensions
----------
Kst extensions allow developers to add functionality that may not be required
by all Kst users, or is more of a peripheral or optional component.
Extensions are loaded on demand of the user.

datasources
-----------
These are runtime loaded plugins which add support in Kst for loading files
of various formats.

plugins
-------
Plugins are Kst-independent loadable modules that implement new mathematical
algorithms for use inside Kst.  These are often of limited or no value to most
users, so they should be implemented as plugins to avoid bloat.
