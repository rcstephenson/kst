List of mimetypes we provide and their definitions:


application/x-kst:
A Kst XML file in full


application/x-kst-fragment:
A Kst XML fragment that can be read and interpreted, but does not describe a
full Kst session.  Unimplemented.


application/x-kst-plot-list:
A list of plot names encoded as a qstringlist.  Used primarily for drag and
drop in the plot dialog.


application/x-kst-plot-names:
A list of plot names encoded as a qstringlist, preceded by a window.  Used for
drag and drop of plots between windows in Kst 1.1.0 only.  DEPRECATED


application/x-kst-legend:
A plot legend.  Contains the window name, the plot name, and the hotspot.  
DEPRECATED


application/x-kst-label-number:
A plot label.  Contains the window name, the plot name, the label number in the
internal list, and the hotspot.   DEPRECATED


application/x-kst-plots:
Unimplemented, reserved for plot dragging.




Do not implement support for drag and drop or copy and paste for the deprecated
mimetypes in any new applications.  They are almost entirely useless there, and
these types will be removed from Kst starting in version 1.2.0.
