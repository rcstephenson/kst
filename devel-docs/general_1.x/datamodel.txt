A Kst session consists of a data model along with a graphical representation of
some or all of that data model.  The data comes from various places known as
data sources.  A data source is a file, network, or other resource that provides
one or more primitives.  A primitive is (presently) a string, scalar, vector or
matrix.  These can be composed with mathematical algorithms by a data object.
Data objects also output one or more primitives.  Primitives can then be
associated as relations, such as a curve.  Relations and primitives can then be
used in graphical representations known as views and view items.

Dialogs and wizards are used to hide these representations from the user.
