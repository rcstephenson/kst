You make a branch with:
svn cp https://svn.kde.org/home/kde/trunk/extragear/graphics https://svn.kde.org/home/kde/branches/work/kst/<mybranchname>

You can then check out your branch from that URL.  It's best to remove the parts
of the branch that you do not need.  Simply check it out with:
svn co https://svn.kde.org/home/kde/branches/work/kst/<mybranchname>
