This program attempts to benchmark the qt/X calls used by kst, to see if your
graphics card is a bottleneck to performance.

To make it, 
qmake -project
qmake
make

Typical kst screen updates are 1-5 Hz, so anything over 20Hz is fine.
The xorg or XFree drivers are ~20% faster in this bench than the ATI binaries.
I have not checked NVIDIA's drivers.

You can expect
ATI 9600: ~30 Hz
NVidia G4 ~35 Hz
ATI 9800: ~50 Hz
ATI 8500: ~30 Hz

S3 on board: 2-6 Hz
Laptop Radeons: 12 Hz - 25 Hz, depending on model and driver.

As with all benchmarks, make sure nothing else is running.

In some cases I have found terrible performance, even though nothing else
was running.  Restarting the X server fixed it.  Not sure why....
